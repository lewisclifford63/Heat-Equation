# 2D Heat Diffusion Animation

This project simulates and visualizes 2D heat diffusion using Python. The script uses finite difference methods to solve the 2D heat equation and generates a continuous animation to display the heat distribution over time.

## Features

- Simulates 2D heat diffusion with reflective boundary conditions.
- Uses a finite difference method to approximate heat distribution.
- Customizable parameters for thermal properties, grid size, and initial conditions.
- Continuous animation playback with a custom color map for easy visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed, along with the required libraries:

pip install numpy matplotlib

### Running the Script

1. Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repository-url>

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd <project-directory>

3. Run the Python script to start the animation:
python heat_diffusion.py

### Customization

You can modify parameters like thermal diffusivity, grid size, and initial conditions directly in the script. Adjust these values to explore different behaviors of the heat diffusion process.
